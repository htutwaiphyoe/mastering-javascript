### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language

Programming => writing code that will instruct computer to do things
High-level => give abstractions and don't have to worry about complex things like memory management
           => easier to write and learn
Object-oriented => based on objects for storing data
Multi-paradigm => can use different styles of programming
               => imperitive and declarative 
               => structuring code

### Role of JavaScript

Three core technologies of web

HTML => responsible for content of the page
     => button, image, etc
     => nouns

CSS => responsible for presentation of the content
    => styling, layouting, etc
    => adjective

JavaScript => responsible for dynamic and interactive effects of the page
           => manipulating content or style and loading data from remote server
           => verbs
